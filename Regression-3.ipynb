    "Ridge regression shares many of the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but there are a few additional considerations\n",

    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the dependent variable. The relationship should be \n",
    "additive, meaning the effect of each predictor is constant and independent of other predictors when their values change.\n",
